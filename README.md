# Logitech-pedals-USB
This simple sketch allows you to connect G25/G27/G29 logitech pedals to a USB port. You need to install the Joystic library (https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) and use Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro (ATmega32u4). This project is based on Amstudio video (https://youtu.be/k5CtXG1rpZg) and 5 axis controller repository.
Once you uploaded the sketch and plagged the cables, go to Game Controllers -> Arduino Leonardo -> Properties -> Settings -> Calibrate and you are ready to go. HAVE FUN!
